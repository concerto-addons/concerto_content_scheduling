Concerto Content Scheduling
===========================
Concerto allows you to schedule content to appear from a start date through an end date.  We will call this the _active period_.  It's up to the shuffler as to when the content appears during that time frame.

This plugin allows you to specify _when_, during the active period, the content should be allowed to appear.  You can specify specific hours of the day, days of the week, month, year, alternating days or weeks, etc.  Lots of recurring/scheduling options.
